"SchoolRumble"

This is a school project for java b / tdd, we were assigned to build a fighting game so
I set my mind to try and build a Heart Stone clone.

So far there is a primitivt AI to play against,
drew up some mock graphics just so the game feels more like a game.
The graphics right now is only templates and will be fix in the future.
The actaul battle is working properly so you can fight and win/lose against the AI.

AI
The AI is very primitiv as of right now. it makes descinsions based on player card count to choose if it should attack
summoner or cards.
