**"SchoolRumble"

This is a school project for java b / tdd, we were assigned to build a fighting game so
I set my mind to try and build a Heart Stone clone.

So far there is a primitivt AI to play against,
drew up some mock graphics to so the game feels more like a game
and the actaul battle is working properly
